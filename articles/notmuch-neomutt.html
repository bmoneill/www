	<h1>How To Filter Emails Using Notmuch's Virtual Mailboxes</h1>
	<p>Notmuch is a very powerful tool for managing email, and I had an issue
	I have been dealing with for a little while now that I realized I
	could use Notmuch for, so I will go through the process I took to
	solve it in this article. I get loads of emails from colleges, and I
	wanted to separate those emails from everything else. Now, I&rsquo;ve heard
	Gmail has this feature, but since I don&rsquo;t use Gmail on my primary
	email address (unfortunately I have a Gmail account for school), I
	decided to figure out how to separate emails from colleges into their
	own mailbox in my mail client, Neomutt.</p>
	<p>First off, when syncing mail, it should automatically tag new mail
	if it matches given queries, like in my case the words &ldquo;college&rdquo; and
	&ldquo;university&rdquo;. I have a script that downloads new mail every five
	minutes in a cronjob, so I added this:</p>

	<pre><code># ~/.local/bin/mailsync
	...
	notmuch new # update notmuch db
	notmuch tag +college "university" and in folder:xyz/INBOX
	notmuch tag +college "college" and in folder:xyz/INBOX
	</code></pre>
	<p>Now every time mail is synced, it will be tagged appropriately. If you
	wanted to perform a Notmuch query for all mail that does not contain
	those phrases, you could type the following:</p>
	<pre><code>$ notmuch search not tag:college
	</code></pre>
	<p>This query can also be used in Neomutt by using virtual mailboxes like
	so:</p>
	<pre><code># ~/.config/mutt/muttrc
	...
	set nm_default_uri="notmuch:///home/ben/.local/share/mail" # replace with your mail dir
	set virtual_spoolfile=yes
	virtual-mailboxes \
	    "Inbox" "notmuch://?query=folder:xyz/INBOX and not tag:college and not tag:spam"\
	    "College" "notmuch://?query=folder:xyz/INBOX and tag:college"\
	    "Sent" "notmuch://?query=folder:xyz/Sent"\
	    ...
	</code></pre>
	<p>This is a super helpful thing for me and it was an interesting
	learning experience setting this up. I hope this can be helpful to
	somebody. Thanks for reading!</p>
