	<h1>Review of a Lenovo Thinkpad X200 With Libreboot</h1>
	<p><a href="https://libreboot.org">Libreboot</a> allows one to free their computer
	from the shackles of proprietary boot firmware, which can restrict the
	operating systems that can be booted or the hardware peripherals that
	can be used with the computer. However, Libreboot is only available on
	older machines. <a href="https://puri.sm">Purism</a>&rsquo;s Librem 5 smartphone and
	<a href="https://www.raptorcs.com/">Raptor Computing Systems</a>&lsquo; Talos II
	desktop are the only machines I know of that have a completely free
	boot firmware from the factory. The Thinkpad X200 sells for way
	cheaper than both of those, and is also a very portable, lightweight
	laptop.</p>
	<h2>My Specs</h2>
	<p>I currently have an Intel Core 2 Duo P8400, a 480GB SSD, and 4GB of
	DDR3 RAM installed in this machine, although it can hold up to 8GB
	DDR3 RAM. I also have a 2TB SSHD in the ultrabase dock&rsquo;s disc drive
	bay. The machine runs fast enough for what I do. It doesn&rsquo;t compile
	code as fast as I wish it could, but that is a sacrifice I must make
	for my freedom.</p>
	<p>I also have a 9-cell battery in the machine, which holds charge for
	about 5-6 hours. I can change out the battery if it runs out, as well,
	which is very useful. I have two spare batteries: one 6-cell and one
	more 9-cell. Finally, I have a wireless card installed that can be
	used with drivers on the linux-libre kernel, as well as an ExpressCard
	3x USB 3.0 port card.</p>
	<h2>The Ultrabase</h2>
	<p>The ultrabase is very useful. I have it plugged in to my external
	monitor, mouse, keyboard, so when I get home I can plug it in and
	use it as a desktop in a few seconds. It is also plugged into a power
	source, and like I said before, there is a 2TB SSHD in the disc drive
	bay.</p>
	<h2>Should You Buy It?</h2>
	<p>Yes. It is not very expensive, and it is very modular. You can
	replace or upgrade parts as needed, and it can run a fully free
	operating system and Libreboot supports it. It is one of the few
	ethical technology items you can purchase. If you find one in decent
	condition for a good price (they range from around $50-250), I&rsquo;d
	recommend buying it.</p>
