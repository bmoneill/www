# Zandra Development Continues

I have recently returned to developing the Zandra Linux distribution, and added
some new packages. I have also been brainstorming possible design changes for
the future. I posted a development log a couple weeks ago
[here](https://zandra.org/log/log-10-26.html). I am open to feedback and
contributions to the project.
