	<h1>Why RSS Is So Important Today</h1>
	<p>RSS is an amazing format for listing news articles, blog posts,
	podcasts, and pretty much anything else. But with Google News,
	Snapchat&rsquo;s news platform, and other news &ldquo;hubs&rdquo;, RSS has become more
	important than ever for preventing the spread of misinformation,
	discrimination based on opinions, and overreliance on corporate
	services.</p>
	
	<p>RSS readers provide the basis for decentralization of information
	received on the internet. If you use an RSS reader, chances are you
	have multiple feeds from different sites on it. This means that you
	are not relying on the same service for all your news. The RSS
	reader you use is hopefully free software; in that case you don&rsquo;t have
	to worry about it disrespecting your freedom, so think of it like a
	mailbox. It takes all the mail you get from these different places and
	puts it in one place. A mailbox doesn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to people with
	certain opinions. It can&rsquo;t discriminate, and neither should your news
	outlet.</p>
	
	<p>RSS readers also happen to be very convenient. Once you copy your
	favorite feeds' URLs into it, it will list the content of all of them
	in a hopefully clean and simple way (I know Newsboat for GNU/Linux and
	spaRSS for Android do). This reason alone is not good enough of
	course, as the aforementioned points are much more important, but it
	does help greatly.</p>
	
	<p>RSS is a great platform for many reasons, so if you&rsquo;re not using it
	yet, a great place to start would be downloading a free app like
	spaRSS or Feeder for Android (in F-Droid for Replicant) or Liferea
	for GNU/Linux. My blog is available on RSS as well under
