<description><pre>Green Line D Branch: Shuttle buses replace service between Riverside and Kenmore from December 11-20 for track work.

All shuttle buses are accessible for persons with disabilities. Shuttle buses will stop at all D Branch stations, except for Beaconsfield. Below are some additional alternate travel options that D Branch riders may consider. 

Alternate Travel Options via Green Line and Bus:
Reservoir - C Branch stop at Cleveland Circle, about a 5 minute walk
Beaconsfield - C Branch stop at Dean Road, about a 4 minute walk
Brookline Hills - Route 60 service, which is available at the intersection of Route 9 and Cypress St, about a 4 minute walk
Brookline Village - E Branch at Riverway, about a 7 minute walk. Additionally, bus routes 60, 65, and 66 are available at Washington St @ Walnut St, about a 5 minute walk. 
Longwood - C Branch stop Kent Street, about a 9 minute walk. 
Fenway - C Branch stop Saint Mary&#x27;s Street, about a 5 minute walk

Alternate Travel Options via Commuter Rail:
Riders who would typically board at Riverside and Woodland may consider the Auburndale and West Newton stops on the Framingham/Worcester Line for service to Lansdowne, Back Bay, and South Station. Lansdowne is about a 7 minute walk from Kenmore and about a 15 minute walk from the Longwood Medical Area. Bus routes 8, 19, 60, and 65 are available on Brookline Ave which is about a 1 minute walk from Lansdowne. These routes serve the Longwood Medical Area and Kenmore.

No Shuttles at Beaconsfield:
Why do shuttles skip Beaconsfield? Due to narrow roads near Beaconsfield, shuttles cannot safely stop there. We recommend taking the Green Line C Branch from Dean Road, about a 4 minute walk.

Affected stops:
Kenmore
Fenway
Longwood
Brookline Village
Brookline Hills
Beaconsfield

<title>Bowdoin Escalator 125 (Lobby to street) is unavailable until further notice.</title>
<description><pre>Bowdoin Escalator 125 (Lobby to street) is unavailable until further notice pending replacement. 

The escalator will remain out of service for the foreseeable future. This decision was made after a thorough inspection determined that corrosion on the escalator’s steel truss was so severe that it could not be repaired further and that a complete replacement of the escalator would be required. Replacing the escalator at this location requires a more extended unit meeting modern escalator safety requirements. This longer unit will require significant alteration to the station entrance to meet code requirements. The MBTA has currently begun design work to understand what station upgrades will be needed. 
  
Due to these complexities, we expect the escalator will remain out of service for a significant time. We recognize the challenges this poses to our riders, and please know we are working to identify a solution as quickly as possible. In the meantime, Government Center Station, which is fully accessible and serves the Blue Line, is under a quarter-mile from Bowdoin Station.
