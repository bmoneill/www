<p>I want to preface my first review by stating my reasoning in becoming a food critic. Frankly,
I like eating food. I am also a student. For these reasons, I will review various cheap takeout
restaurants (I take suggestions).</p>
<p>Thaitation is a small, charming restaurant located between Fenway Park and the Museum of Fine Arts.
The building stands out, with its distinct wood design. Prices are good. I got the Pad Thai for $11.50,
which was pretty good, but nothing special. There wasn't enough flavor, but it was filling and didn't
taste bad. It had chicken, shrimp, noodles, peanuts, and bean sprouts. Overall, I give it a 6/10.</p>
