		<h1>Thaitation Review</h1>
		<p>I want to preface my first review by stating my reasoning in becoming a food critic. Frankly,
		I like eating food. I am also a student. For these reasons, I will review various cheap takeout
		restaurants (I take suggestions).</p>
		<p>Thaitation is a small, charming restaurant located at 129 Jersey Street in Boston, MA, between
		Fenway Park and the Museum of Fine Arts. The building stands out, with its distinct wood design.
		Prices are good. I got the Pad Thai for $11.50, which was pretty good, but nothing special.
		There wasn't enough flavor, but it was filling and didn't taste bad. It had chicken, shrimp,
		noodles, peanuts, and bean sprouts. Overall, I give Thaitation a 6/10.</p>
